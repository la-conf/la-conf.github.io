This is [a good list of the options for getting to Paris from Charles de Gaulle Airport](http://goparis.about.com/od/transportation/f/GroundTransport.htm).

**A taxi** is the most convenient, but also most expensive. Uber and LeCab have fixed rates from the airport, so if you can share with others this will probably be quite reasonable as well as extremely convenient. Be sure to download the respective apps before you leave.

Next are the **shuttle busses**; reserve in advance, and note that the Air France bus to Gare de Lyon is probably the best choice because you end up in the neighborhood of the conference venues. [This is the ticket you want](https://one.secutix.com/tnsa7/live/shop/cars/INTERNET/ts/event/seat_selection.php?CNSACTION=TS_SELECT_REPRESENTATION&resa_event_code=LIGNE4&resa_product_code=ARRPMS@300615-1200&resa_system=tnce7&organizer_code=AIR&ts_event_display_mode=LIST&lang=en).

**Want the full Parisian experience?** Take the trip from CDG to Paris on the RER B. You want to go to Châtelet Les Halles (not Gare du Nord!) and then switch to the RER D or the Metro. There are apps for Android and iPhone to help with Metro trip planning, and many don’t require a network connection. If you have a chip & PIN credit card (if you don’t know what that means, you don’t have one), you can buy your ticket from one of the machines. Otherwise you will have to go to a ticket window where you see the ‘RER’ sign. It’s probably best to buy your return ticket at the same time.

Here are [some more details about the trip](http://parisbytrain.com/charles-de-gaulle-airport-cdg-to-paris-by-train/).

## Transport within Paris

Here is [a great site with details about the “t+” tickets](http://parisbytrain.com/paris-metro-ticket-t-in-detail/) you will probably use to get around in the city.

You won’t need these for the conference unless your hotel is too far from the venues, but you will probably want some tickets to explore the night life.

### Some Metro tips

- Buying a carnet (10 tickets) is the best way to be sure you have a ticket handy, and you get a nice discount too.
- The Mobilis day-pass is great if you want to see a lot of places in a single day, but take care not to fold it!
- Don’t forget that the Metro does stop running late at night.
- The Metro and the RER use different tickets (though there are exceptions).
