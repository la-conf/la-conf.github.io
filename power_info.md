You will certainly want to plug some things in while you're visiting Paris.
Since the plugs are different and the power is different, you will need an
adapter and in some cases, a transformer. Most laptop power bricks can work
just as well with 230v as with 120v. Read the fine print on your power brick,
looking for something that says this explicitly.

This adapter shows that it will accept 240v at 50Hz (on the line that starts
'INPUT'), and that is what you'll find in Paris. Most modern computers and phone
chargers will accept this. For those, you will need only an adapter so your
two-spade plug can connect to a two-post socket. Some hotels have adapters
available, or you can get them at a travel store or at the airport.

Often camera chargers and grooming appliances (shavers, hair curlers, etc.)
will accept only one power specification. If you don't see a label that tells
you that your device will accept 230v at 50Hz, you will need a transformer that
outputs the voltage and frequency required by your device. Again, you cna get
these at a travel store or at the airport. 

If you get to France and don't have the adapter or transformer that you need,
you can get adapters at BHV in the Marais, in the basement. For transformers,
check a FNAC store or ask the concierge at your hotel.
